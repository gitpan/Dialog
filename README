                            BAD NEWS

This module is dirty approximation to the features of FreeBSD's
libdialog. It's poor and nasty. Please, don't consider it works
at all.

                            GOOD NEWS

It really works. Volgalink Co. (http://www.vlink.ru/) uses it
for it's own purposes for three or even more years

                          BAD NEWS AGAIN

It's being compiled on FreeBSD only. Linux and others are
coming.

                            MAYBE GOOD

If somebody ported libdialog to, say, Linux, it would mean that
you got this OS supported.
